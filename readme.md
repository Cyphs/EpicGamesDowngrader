# Downgrade tool for Hogwarts Legacy

this repository contains a script that is used by epic players to download a older version of among us during times when mods are uncompatible
with the latest version of the game. The third party tool [legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary) is used.

# Common issues

1. The script may instantly close.
   <br> Solution:
    - search powershell in your windows search bar and open it <br>
    - navigate to the folder the script is in, by doing for example ```cd downloads``` or ```cd desktop``` <br>
    - write ```Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process``` and click enter <br>
    - write ```./DowngradeEpic.ps1``` and click enter <br>
2. Make sure your Epic Games account owns Hogwarts Legacy.
